Tarot reaeder simulation done for Hackday at Salt.

As this project was completed in under two days, it is still in a beta state and needs fixing. 

How to app works: Spread a stack of 22 cards in random order, and based on user selection, they will have different readings from 44 different possibilities: 22 base tarot cards in upright position or reversed position. Each card has their own representing signification.

Purpose of the app: To simulate the experience of having your cards read.

Each card information is stored on an SQL database. Project was created in React.
