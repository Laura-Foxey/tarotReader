# tarotReader

Project in progress!

Tarot Reader project built within one day for HackDay at school.
For this project, the goal was to build a simple webapp to include a React front-end, ASP.NET back-end and a database. The database was deployed by Docker.

The point of the 'game' is to simulate the experience of having your cards read, by generating a random order of cards the client can select. It was designed to have the cards get randomized on page refresh. 

Each available card information, in total 44, are stored within the database which gets displayed on the screen, matching the ID of the blindly selected cards. 

A large portion of the project was focused on the front-end.
